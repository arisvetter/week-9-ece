## Lab Questions

### In plain English describe the function and use of a multiplexer.

A multiplexor selects between different input options and forwards one of the input options along. The selection choice is based on a selector switch(or multiple switches).

### In plain English describe the function and use of a demultiplexer.
A demultiplexer is the reverse of a multiplexer--it selects one output of multiple, based on one input. That input is the selector switch(es).

### What other uses might these circuits have? (Think Shannonâ€™s)
